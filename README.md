# My notes for everything

This is a [repo](https://github.com/elimelt/notes) where I store my notes and resources. I write my notes in markdown with vim, and use a custom [GUI](https://elimelt.com/notes) to view them. Some of them are taken while reading textbooks, and others are taken in real time during lectures.

Please note that much of the info on here is paraphrased from other sources, and I claim no ownership of it. This is also a work in progress, and I am constantly adding to and editing it. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [reach out](https://elimelt.com/contact).

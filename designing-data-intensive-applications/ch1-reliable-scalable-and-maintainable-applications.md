## Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

### "Data intensive" vs. "Computer intensive"

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks:

- Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream proessing)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)

### Reliability
A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.

#### Hardware faults (hard disk crashes, RAM errors, etc.)

#### Software faults (crashes, runaway process, slowdowns, cascading failures, etc.)
Lots of small things can help: carefully thinking about assumptions and interactions in the system; thorough testing; process isolation; allowing processes to crash and restart; measuring, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior in production. If a system is expected to provide some guarantee (for example, in a message queue, that the num‚Äê ber of incoming messages equals the number of outgoing messages), it can constantly check itself while it is running and raise an alert if a discrepancy is found

#### Human errors (operator error, configuration error, etc.)
- Design systems in a way that minimizes opportunities for error.
- Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the places where they can cause failures.
- Test thoroughly at all levels.
- Allow quick and easy recovery
- Set up detailed and clear monitoring

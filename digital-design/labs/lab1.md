# Task 1 - SystemVerilog Design and Simulation

1. mux4_1 takes in 4 data inputs and 2 select inputs, and outputs the data input corresponding to the select input. The sel bits are sort of treated like a binary number which indexes into an array of data inputs.

# Task 2 - Logic Investigation

1. Setting LEDR to TRUE will turn on the red LED.
2. Flipping switch N up will turn SWN to TRUE.
3. The push keys being unpressed outputs a TRUE.

# Task 3 - Add Simple Logic

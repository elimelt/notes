# Transport Layer Overview

The transport layer provides end-to-end connectivity accross the network. Segments carry application data, which are carried within packets, which are carried within frames. 

The two main services are **messages (datagram, UDP)** and **bytestreams (streams, TCP)**. Messages are discrete units of data, while bytestreams are continuous streams of data.

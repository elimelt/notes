# Application Layer Overview

Applications built upon TCP have the benefit of being able to transfer arbitrary length data. Also provides reliability and flow control. However, some applications may not require these features and may be better suited to use UDP. Some applications even need to use UDP because they can't handle the overhead of TCP (like skype or online gaming).

## C-SWAP

Cost, Size, Weight and Power

### Cost

Tradeoff between consumable vs reusable.

### Size + Weight

Driven by power in many cases because of mass/volume to energy constraints

### Power

How much time do you use between charges. Device dissipates heat (ROT 10 mW/cm^3 -> 2 deg C)

3 key sources: sensing, computing, communication.

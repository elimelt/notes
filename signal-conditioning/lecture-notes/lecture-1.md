title: C-SWAP: Cost, Size, Weight and Power
category: Hardware
tags: cost, size, weight, power, hardware, energy constraints, heat dissipation, sensing, computing, communication
description: Covers the implementation considerations for hardware systems with respect to cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWAP) constraints. Discusses the trade-offs between these factors and their impact on the design of sensing, computing, and communication components. Provides guidance on optimizing hardware designs to meet energy and thermal requirements.

## C-SWAP

Cost, Size, Weight and Power

### Cost

Tradeoff between consumable vs reusable.

### Size + Weight

Driven by power in many cases because of mass/volume to energy constraints

### Power

How much time do you use between charges. Device dissipates heat (ROT 10 mW/cm^3 -> 2 deg C)

3 key sources: sensing, computing, communication.

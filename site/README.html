<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/elimelt/notes">repo</a> where I store my notes and resources. I write my notes in markdown with vim, and use a custom <a href="https://elimelt.com/notes">GUI</a> to view them. Some of them are taken while reading textbooks, and others are taken in real time during lectures.</p>
<p>Please note that much of the info on here is paraphrased from other sources, and I claim no ownership of it. This is also a work in progress, and I am constantly adding to and editing it. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to <a href="https://elimelt.com/contact">reach out</a>.</p>

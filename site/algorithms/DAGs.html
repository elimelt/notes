        <h1>Topological Ordering and Properties of Directed Acyclic Graphs</h1>

<p>DAGs are pretty self explanatory, but their use cases are vast.</p>
<h2 id="topological-orderings"><a class="toclink" href="#topological-orderings">Topological Orderings</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>topological ordering</strong> of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that for every directed edge $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, $v_i$ comes before $v_j$ in the ordering if $v_i &lt; v_j$.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: If $G$ has a topological ordering, then $G$ is a DAG.
<strong>Proof</strong>: For contradiction, assume $G$ has a cycle $v_0, \ldots , v_k$, as well as a topological ordering.</p>
<p>We can order vertices $u_1, \ldots, u_n$ such that $\forall \text{ directed edges } i \to j$, we have $i &lt; j$.</p>
<p>Take the smallest $u_i = v_j$ in the cycle mentioned previously. Then $v_{j - 1} \to v_{j}$ and $v_{j} \to v_{j + 1}$ violate our ordering, since $v_j$ was the minimum in the topological ordering (so both $v_{(j - 1) \mod k}$ and $v_{(j + 1) \mod k}$ are greater).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: If $G$ is a DAG, then $G$ has a source vertex ($indeg(v) = 0$).
<strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose for contradiction that $G$ has no source vertex.</p>
<p>i.e., $\forall v \in V, \, indeg(v) \ge 1$</p>
<p>Consider an arbitrary vertex $v_1$. Then $v_1$ has some neighbor(s) $v_2, \ldots$ with an edge into it. Similarly, $v_2$ has some neighbor(s) $v_i, \ldots$ with edges coming into it. You can continue this logic, and must eventually find a repeating vertex, since there are finitely many vertices.</p>

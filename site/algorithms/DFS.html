<p>Running DFS on a graph produces a DFS tree (or depth-first spanning-tree). The DFS tree contains all the vertices of the graph and the edges of the DFS tree are a subset of the edges of the original graph.</p>
<p>Unlike the BFS tree, DFS trees aren't minimum depth, and its levels don't really tell you much. However, the property holds that sub-trees of a DFS tree must not contain any edges connecting them.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: For a DFS tree of graph $G = (V, E)$ $T = (V_t, E_t)$,  $\forall e = (x, y) \in E$, if $e \notin E_t$, then one of $x$ or $y$ is an ancestor of the other in the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Without loss of generality, assume $x$ is discovered first.</p>
<p>Call $dfs(x)$. At this time, $y$ is still undiscovered. By observation, it is enough to say $y$ will be discovered before finishing $dfs(x)$. This is true because $y$ is a neighbor of $x$, so DFS will eventually visit $y$. If $y$ is still undiscovered when $x$ we visit $x$'s neighbors, it will at least be discovered then.</p>

<p>DFS visits every vertex within the starting vertex's connected component, so you can use it to find all connected components of a graph similar to BFS.</p>
<p>However, unlike BFS, the DFS tree has the property that every non-tree edge joins a vertex to one of its ancestors/decedents in the tree. We can thus still use DFS to find cycles in a graph.</p>

        <h1>Finding Connected Components in Undirected Graphs Using BFS/DFS</h1>
        <h1 id="connected-components"><a class="toclink" href="#connected-components">Connected Components</a></h1>
<p>Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, you can find partition $V$ into sets of connected components $C_1, C_2, \ldots$ in $O(|V| + |E|)$ using breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS).</p>
<p>In other words, we can create a data structure from $G$ such that given two vertices $u, v \in V$, we  we answer whether there exists a path from $u \to v$ in $O(1)$ time and $O(|V|)$ space.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to run a BFS/DFS starting at every vertex, and to assign a label to each vertex we visit during this traversal. We can use an array (if vertices are numbered) or hash map to store the vertex to component set mapping $V \to C_i$</p>

<p>In general, if you are solving a graph problem you should first assume your graph is fully connected, and then after you've found a solution for connected graphs, you can run your algorithm on all the connected components of your graph.</p>

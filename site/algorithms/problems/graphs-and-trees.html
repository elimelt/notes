<h2 id="problem-1"><a class="toclink" href="#problem-1">Problem 1</a></h2>
<p>Let $G$ be a tree. Use induction to prove that the number of leaves of $G$ is at least the number of vertices of degree at least $3$ in $G$.</p>
<h4 id="solution"><a class="toclink" href="#solution">Solution</a></h4>
<p>$P(n)$: The number of leaves of any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is at least the number of vertices of degree at least $3$ in $G$.</p>
<h4 id="base-case-p1"><a class="toclink" href="#base-case-p1">Base Case: $P(1)$</a></h4>
<p>A tree with one vertex has no leaves or vertices of degree at least $3$, so the base case holds.</p>
<h4 id="ih-assume-pk-holds-for-some-k-ge-1"><a class="toclink" href="#ih-assume-pk-holds-for-some-k-ge-1">IH: Assume $P(k)$ holds for some $k \ge 1$.</a></h4>
<h4 id="is-we-want-to-show-that-pk-1-holds"><a class="toclink" href="#is-we-want-to-show-that-pk-1-holds">IS: We want to show that $P(k + 1)$ holds.</a></h4>
<p>Let $G = (V, E)$ be a tree with $|V| = k + 1$.</p>
<p>Choose some arbitrary leaf $l \in V$, and $(l, p) \in E$. Removing $l$ (and its corresponding edge) from $G$ results in a tree $G' = (V', E')$ with $|V'| = k$. By the IH, $G'$ satisfies $P(k)$.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>: $p$ has degree $1$ in $G'$.</p>
<p>Then $p$ is a leaf in $G'$, and $G'$ has the same number of leaves and vertices with degree 3 as $G$ (since we didn't remove any vertices of degree 3). Thus, $G$ has at least as many leaves as vertices of degree 3.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>: $p$ has degree $2$ in $G'$.</p>
<p>Then $p$ is not a leaf in $G'$, and $G'$ has one fewer leaf than $G$ (since we removed a leaf). However, we also removed a vertex of degree 3 from $G$, so the number of vertices of degree 3 in $G$ is still at least the number of leaves in $G$ (both increased by 1 from $G' \to G$).</p>
<p><strong>Case 3</strong>: $p$ has degree at least $3$ in $G'$.</p>
<p>Then $p$ is a vertex of degree at least $3$ in $G$, and $G$ has the same number of vertices of degree greater than or equal to $3$ as $G'$. Since we only add a leaf to $G'$ to get $G$, the number of leaves in $G$ is at least the number of leaves in $G'$, which is at least the number of vertices of degree at least $3$ in $G'$.</p>
<p>In all cases, $G$ has at least as many leaves as vertices of degree at least $3$, so $P(k + 1)$ holds.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2"><a class="toclink" href="#problem-2">Problem 2</a></h2>
<p>Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and at least $n$ edges. Show that $G$ has a cycle.</p>
<h4 id="solution_1"><a class="toclink" href="#solution_1">Solution</a></h4>
<p>Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and at least $n$ edges. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $G$ has no cycles.</p>
<p>Since $G$ has no cycles, it is a tree.</p>
<p>Claim: The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.</p>
<p>Proof: Each edge contributes $1$ to the degree of two vertices, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges.</p>

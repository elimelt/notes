<p>A graph is a tree if and only if it is acyclic and connected.</p>
<h2 id="claim-every-tree-with-n-vertices-has-n-1-edges"><a class="toclink" href="#claim-every-tree-with-n-vertices-has-n-1-edges">Claim: Every tree with $n$ vertices has $n - 1$ edges.</a></h2>
<p>Proof by induction.</p>
<p>Base case: $n = 1$. A tree with 1 vertex has 0 edges.</p>
<p>IH: Suppose every tree with $n - 1$ vertices has $n - 2$ edges ($P(n - 1)$).</p>
<p>IS: Let $T$ be a tree with $n$ vertices.</p>
<p>$T$ must have a vertex of degree 1 (since it is by definition acyclic). Remove this vertex and its edge to get a tree $T'$ with $n - 1$ vertices. By IH, $T'$ has $n - 2$ edges. Adding back the vertex and edge, we get $n - 1$ edges.</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-trees"><a class="toclink" href="#properties-of-trees">Properties of Trees</a></h2>
<p>Any graph $G$ that satisfies two of the following properties must satisfy the third (and thus be a tree):</p>
<ul>
<li>$G$ is connected</li>
<li>$G$ is acyclic</li>
<li>$G$ has $|V| - 1$ edges</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="undirected-graphs"><a class="toclink" href="#undirected-graphs">Undirected Graphs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>$|E| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in V} deg(v)$</li>
<li>The number of odd degree vertices is even</li>
<li>If a graph is acyclic, there is a vertex of degree $\le 1$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trees"><a class="toclink" href="#trees">Trees</a></h2>
<p>For any graph $G = (V, E)$, if two of the following are true, then all three are and $G$ is a tree</p>
<ul>
<li>$|E| = |V| - 1$</li>
<li>$G$ is connected</li>
<li>$G$ is acyclic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breadth-first-search"><a class="toclink" href="#breadth-first-search">Breadth-First Search</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>$BFS(s)$ visits $v$ iff there is a path from $s \to v$</li>
<li>Edges into then-undiscovered vertices define the BFS-tree of $G$</li>
<li>Level $i$ of the BFS-tree contains all vertices with shortest path $i$ from the root</li>
<li><strong>All non-tree edges</strong> join vertices on the same, or adjacent levels of the tree</li>
<li>If $G$ contains edges between vertices in the same layer, it is not bipartite, nor a tree</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bipartite-graphs"><a class="toclink" href="#bipartite-graphs">Bipartite Graphs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>$G$ is bipartite iff you can partition $V$ into $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that all edges are between $V_1$ and $V_2$, i.e. no edges between vertices in different sets</li>
<li>$G$ is bipartite iff $G$ has no odd cycles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="depth-first-search"><a class="toclink" href="#depth-first-search">Depth First Search</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>$DFS(s)$ visits $x$ iff there is a path from $s \to x$ (so you can find C.C.s)</li>
<li>DFS Spanning Tree formed by edges into then-undiscovered vertices</li>
<li>DFS tree not minimum depth, nor do its levels reflect the min distance</li>
<li>Non-tree edges never join vertices on the same or adjacent level. Always join a vertex with one of its ancestors or descendants</li>
<li>All vertices visited during $DFS(s)$ are a descendant of $s$ in the DFS tree<ul>
<li>For every edge $(u, v) \notin T_{DFS(s)}$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$ is an ancestor of $x$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directed-acyclic-graphs"><a class="toclink" href="#directed-acyclic-graphs">Directed Acyclic Graphs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: vertex with no incoming edges</li>
<li><strong>Sink</strong>: vertex with no outgoing edges</li>
<li>Every DAG has a source and a sink</li>
<li>Every DAG has a topological order, and every graph with a topological order is a DAG</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="topological-order"><a class="toclink" href="#topological-order">Topological Order</a></h3>
<p>An ordering of nodes $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ so that for every edge $(v_i, v_j)$, $i &lt; j$.</p>
<ul>
<li>To find, initialize map of in-degrees for each vertex, and a queue of vertices with in-degree 0.</li>
<li>Then, while the queue isn't empty, remove a vertex, adding it to the ordering, and decrement its neighbors in-degree.</li>
<li>If any of them become 0, add them to the queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cuts"><a class="toclink" href="#cuts">Cuts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A cut of $G = (V, E)$ is a bipartition of $V$ into $S, V - S$ for some $S \subseteq V$</li>
<li>$e = (u, v) \in (S, V - S)$ if exactly one of $u, v \in S$</li>
<li>If $G$ is connected, then there is at least one edge in every cut</li>
<li>Every cycle crosses a cut an even number of times</li>
<li><em>Cut property</em>: Let $(S, V - S)$ be any cut, and let $e$ be the <strong>min</strong> cost edge with exactly <strong>one</strong> endpoint in $S$. Then <strong>every</strong> MST contains $e$.</li>
<li><em>Cycle property</em>: Let $C$ be any cycle, and $f$ be the <strong>max</strong> cost edge belonging to $C$. Then <strong>no</strong> MST contains $f$.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimum-spanning-tree"><a class="toclink" href="#minimum-spanning-tree">Minimum Spanning Tree</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm</strong>: $O(m\log(n))$</li>
<li>Sort edges by increasing weight, initialize an empty tree $T$, and add each vertex to its own set.</li>
<li>Then, for each edge $e = (u, v)$, if $u$ and $v$ are currently in different sets, add $e$ to $T$ and merge the sets containing $u$ and $v$.</li>
<li><strong>Proof</strong>:</li>
<li>Show that it is a tree<ul>
<li>Initially start with $|V| = n$ sets, and only add an edge if you are connecting two of them. Therefore, we end with $n - 1$ sets to add an edge between each original set</li>
<li>Only add edges between disconnected components, so it must be acyclic, since each additional edge $e$ connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$ (two disconnected components) is the only edge between them. This means $C_1 + e + C_2$ has an odd number of edges in its cut, so there are no cycles formed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Must be an MST<ul>
<li>Considered edges in increasing order of cost. Taking the first edge where the optimal and Kruskal's differ, we can exchange them for an equal or better solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disjoint-sets"><a class="toclink" href="#disjoint-sets">Disjoint Sets</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>:</li>
<li>Maintain a tree of pointers, where every vertex is labeled with the longest path ending at that vertex. To check set membership of $u$ and $v$, traverse to root and check if $root(u) = root(v)$. This is $O(\log(n))$</li>
<li>To merge two sets, point root with smaller label to root with larger label, adjusting labels of the new root if necessary. This is $O(1)$.</li>
<li><strong>Properties</strong>:</li>
<li>If the label of a root is $k$, there are at least $2^k$ elements in the set.</li>

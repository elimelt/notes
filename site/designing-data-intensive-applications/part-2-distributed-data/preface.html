<p>Moving up a level to data systems that run on multiple machines, we still care about similar things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: splitting load between multiple machines</li>
<li><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>: tolerating failure at one or more machines</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: minimizing the time between a request and response using geographic proximity of CDNs, caching, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scaling-up"><a class="toclink" href="#scaling-up">Scaling Up</a></h3>
<p><strong>Shared memory architecture</strong> is a single computer with multiple CPUs, each with their own cache and memory. The CPUs communicate via a shared memory bus. Prices to double power of machine quickly become prohibitive, and the shared memory bus becomes a bottleneck anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Disk Architecture</strong> is a multi machine setup with each machine having its own CPU and memory, but all machines share a disk over the network. This is a bit better, but the disk becomes a bottleneck.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-out"><a class="toclink" href="#scaling-out">Scaling Out</a></h3>
<p><strong>Shared Nothing Architecture</strong> is a multi machine setup with each machine having its own CPU, memory, and disk. This is the most scalable, but it requires a lot of coordination between machines. Each machine (or VM) is a <strong>node</strong>, and each node is completely independent. Inter-node communication is done over the network through software. </p>
<p><strong>For the remainder of this part (Part 2), we will be focusing on shared nothing architectures.</strong></p>

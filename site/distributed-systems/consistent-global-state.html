<h2 id="introduction"><a class="toclink" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Many problems in distributed computing boil down to being able to maintain a consistent global state, and to run predicates on that state in order to trigger events. The true state of a distributed system is the union of all node's states. However, since nodes don't share memory, the actual state must be meaningful when inferred solely based on messages passed among nodes.</p>
<p>A global state is said to be <em>inconsistent</em> if it never could have been constructed by an ideal external observer. This paper formalizes this concept into the context of a <strong>Global Predicate Evaluation (GPE)</strong>, which determines if the system satisfies some predicate $\Phi$.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-distributed-systems"><a class="toclink" href="#asynchronous-distributed-systems">Asynchronous Distributed Systems</a></h2>
<p>Define a distributed system as a set $P$ of <em>sequential</em> processes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, and a network consisting of <em>channels</em> in which unidirectional communication is possible in the space of $P^2$. The network is assumed to be reliable, but may deliver messages out of order, and is taken to be <em>strongly connected</em>, but not necessarily <em>fully connected</em> (i.e. communication may require intermediate message passing).</p>
<p>It is useful to reason about distributed systems with the weakest possible assumptions, such that results hold for arbitrary systems.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-computations"><a class="toclink" href="#distributed-computations">Distributed Computations</a></h2>
<p>A distributed computation is the execution of a distributed program over a collection of processes, each of which sequentially process a stream of <em>events</em>. Particularly, for two nodes to communicate, a message $m$ is enqueued on a channel via $send(m)$, and the message is dequeued via $receive(m)$. There is an obvious relationship between the happening of event $send(m)$ at process $p$, and the happening of event $receive(m)$ at process $q$, such that we can be sure $send(m)$ happened before $receive(m)$.</p>

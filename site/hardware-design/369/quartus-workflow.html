        <h1>Developing FPGA Designs with Quartus and ModelSim</h1>
        <ul>
<li>Make a copy of a previous lab directory to build off of what you already have (Quartus project file, ModelSim files) while keeping the old design as a reference.</li>
<li>For each module you need to write:</li>
<li>Create and populate two new files, one for the module definition and one for that module's test bench.</li>
<li>Set the new module file as the top-level module in Quartus.</li>
<li>Run Analysis and Synthesis and fix any errors it finds.</li>
<li>Edit runlab.do to include the new module and run its test bench and yet-to-be created simulation view.</li>
<li>Start ModelSim and perform "do runlab.do." Fix any errors the compiler finds.</li>
<li>When it complains about a missing *_wave.do file, set up the Wave pane by drag-and dropping signals from the Object pane. Save the waveform setup using File -&gt; "Save Formatting", then perform "do runlab.do" again.</li>
<li>Check the simulation results, correct errors, and iterate until the module works as intended.This process has two major features: First, it has you test every module before you work on the larger  modules that call this unit. This will significantly simplify the design process. Second, you have a separate <em>_wave.do file for each Verilog file. This keeps a formatted test window for each module, which can help when you discover a fresh bug in a larger design later on. You can always go back and test a submodule by simply editing the runlab.do file to point to the testbench and </em>_wave.do file for the unit you want to test</li>

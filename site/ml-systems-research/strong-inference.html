<h3 id="what-is-the-problem">What is the Problem?</h3>
<p>The process of doing research has become less standardized in some fields, especially when compared to the more structured approach of fields like molecular bio and high-energy physics.</p>
<p>When a formal scientific method isn't adhered to, especially when formulating hypotheses, the process can become less efficient and less effective, leading to fewer discoveries and slower progress over time.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>John R. Platt critiques the application of the scientific method in modern research, arguing that the process has become less structured and less effective in some fields. He proposes a more structured approach to hypothesis formulation, which he calls "strong inference".</p>
<p>The paper goes on quite a bit about historical examples of the principles of strong inference working in practice, as well as a detailed breakdown of how to systematically apply the method to research.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Devise alternative hypotheses</strong> - Generate multiple competing hypotheses that could explain the phenomenon being studied.</li>
<li><strong>Devise a crucial experiment</strong> - Design an experiment that can unambiguously distinguish between the competing hypotheses, or at the very least, eliminate some or all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Carry out the experiment</strong> - Conduct the experiment and analyze the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Strong inference is essentially to carry out this process at every vertex of the logical tree of inquiry, and to do so in a systematic and structured way. He suggests keeping a notebook explicitly for this, and to pay particular attention to the process of hypothesis generation.</p>
<h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have multiple <strong>competing hypotheses</strong>, and come up with the most efficient way to eliminate them via experimentation.</li>
<li><strong>Systematically</strong>, explicitly, and <em>regularly</em> follow this process, from hypothesis generation to experimentation to analysis.</li>
<li>Ask yourself the two questions: "How would we know this hypothesis is wrong?" and "What hypothesis does this experiment disprove?"</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notable-design-detailsstrengths">Notable Design Details/Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deviations from strong inference only really manifest themselves as useless delays in the research process. Many scientists do a lot of busywork for no reason, which could be avoided had they spent more time formulating hypotheses.</li>
<li>Strong inference is strongly dependent on the actual induction being done when formulating hypotheses. This <strong>needs</strong> to be logically sound.</li>
<li>It is a system that <strong>works</strong> if done correctly, as it's essentially the minimum amount of work needed to make a discovery without just getting lucky.</li>
</ul>

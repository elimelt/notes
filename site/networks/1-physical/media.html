        <h1>Media in Networks</h1>
        <h1 id="media"><a class="toclink" href="#media">Media</a></h1>
<p><em>Media</em> propagates signals that carry information.</p>
<h2 id="wires"><a class="toclink" href="#wires">Wires</a></h2>
<h3 id="twisted-pair"><a class="toclink" href="#twisted-pair">Twisted Pair</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Very common in LANs and phone lines. </li>
<li>Two insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce radiation/crosstalk, leading to less interference.</li>
</ul>
<p>EX: Ethernet, DSL</p>
<h3 id="coaxial-cable"><a class="toclink" href="#coaxial-cable">Coaxial Cable</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Copper core, surrounded by insulating material, surrounded by braided metal shield, surrounded by protective outer layer of plastic.</li>
<li>Support higher data rates than twisted pair.</li>
<li>Longer distances and better shielding.</li>
<li>More expensive and harder to install than twisted pair. They are pretty inflexible.</li>
</ul>
<p>EX: Cable TV, Internet</p>
<h3 id="fiber"><a class="toclink" href="#fiber">Fiber</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Long, thin, pure glass strands that carry modulated light.</li>
<li>Very high data rates and long distances.</li>
<li>Immune to electromagnetic interference.</li>
<li>Expensive and hard to install.</li>
<li>Muli-mode vs. single-mode fiber is just a matter of multiple or single paths for light to travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>EX: Internet backbone</p>
<h2 id="wireless"><a class="toclink" href="#wireless">Wireless</a></h2>
<p>Sends signals in all directions through a region of space. Nearby signals can <strong>interfere</strong> with each other, especially if they are on the same frequency; must coordinate use over time and frequency.</p>
<p>Wifi largely uses unlicensed spectrum, which is free to use but can be crowded. Interference can be a big problem. For example, turning on your microwave can interfere with your wifi.</p>
<p>Signals can take multiple paths (<strong>multipath</strong>), and are affected by physical barriers. The higher the frequency, the more easily it is absorbed by walls and other obstacles (this is why 5G sucks).</p>
<h3 id="channel-properties"><a class="toclink" href="#channel-properties">Channel Properties</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bandwidth (Hz)</strong>: The range of frequencies that the channel can carry. Note that bandwidth in this context is not the same as the <em>data-rate</em> of a link.</li>
<li><strong>Signal Power (Watts)</strong>: The strength of the signal.</li>
<li><strong>Noise Power (Watts)</strong>: The strength of the noise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nyquist-limit"><a class="toclink" href="#nyquist-limit">Nyquist Limit</a></h3>
<p>The max <strong>symbol-rate</strong> (rate at which symbols are sent) is twice the bandwidth. This would mean maintaining a maximum frequency, and sending a signal for each peak or trough of the wave.</p>
<p>If there are $V$ signal levels, ignoring noise, the max data rate is $2B \log_2(V)$ bits/sec.</p>
<h3 id="shannon-capacity"><a class="toclink" href="#shannon-capacity">Shannon Capacity</a></h3>
<p>The number of levels we can distinguish is limited by the ratio of signal power to noise power. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the signal power to the noise power, and the higher the SNR, the more levels we can distinguish. Usually measured in decibels (dB).</p>
<p>$$
SNR_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{S}{N} \right)
$$</p>
<p>Capacity (C) is the max <strong>lossless</strong> data rate over a channel. Don't ask me how to derive this...</p>
<p>$$
C = B \log_2 \left( 1 + \frac{S}{N} \right)
$$</p>
<p>Note that increasing bandwidth increases the capacity linearly, but increasing SNR increases the capacity logarithmically.</p>

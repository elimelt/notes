        <h1>Multiple Access</h1>
        <h1 id="multiple-access"><a class="toclink" href="#multiple-access">Multiple Access</a></h1>
<h2 id="multiplexing"><a class="toclink" href="#multiplexing">Multiplexing</a></h2>
<p><strong>Multiplexing</strong> is the networking concept of sharing a resource among multiple clients. Network traffic is generally bursty, to the point that two concurrent users each using 1 Mbps of bandwidth might only need 1.5 Mbps of bandwidth to share. Multiplexing allows for this sharing.</p>
<h3 id="time-division-multiplexing-tdm"><a class="toclink" href="#time-division-multiplexing-tdm">Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)</a></h3>
<p>Users take turns on a fixed schedule, often being scheduled in a round-robin fashion.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-division-multiplexing-fdm"><a class="toclink" href="#frequency-division-multiplexing-fdm">Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)</a></h3>
<p>Users are assigned different frequency bands, and can transmit at the same time, interfering minimally with each other.</p>
<h3 id="tdm-vs-fdm"><a class="toclink" href="#tdm-vs-fdm">TDM vs. FDM</a></h3>
<p>In TDM, users send at a high rate for a short time, while in FDM, users send at a low rate contantly. For a fixed number of users, TDM might be better if the users are bursty, while FDM might be better if the users are constant.</p>
<p>Ex: TV and radio use FDM, while GSM (2G cellular) uses TDM within FDM.</p>
<h2 id="controlling-access"><a class="toclink" href="#controlling-access">Controlling Access</a></h2>
<p>Two classes: <strong>centralized</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="centralized"><a class="toclink" href="#centralized">Centralized</a></h3>
<p>Uses a privileged "Scheduler" to allocate resources/coordinate access. This usually scales well vertically and has low overhead, but is a single point of failure and doesn't hold up with the demands of the modern internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex: Cellular networks, where the base station schedules access to the channel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distributed"><a class="toclink" href="#distributed">Distributed</a></h3>
<p>All of the participants "figure it out" themselves. Scaling this is really hard, but it operates well under low load, is easy to set up, and is very fault-tolerant (not to mention the benefits of being decentralized).</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex: Wifi, Ethernet, and the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distributed-random-access"><a class="toclink" href="#distributed-random-access">Distributed (Random) Access</a></h3>
<p>Assumes noone is in charge, and that everyone is trying to access the channel at the same time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALOHA Protocol</strong>: Send whenever you want, and if there's a collision (no ACK), wait a random amount of time and try again. This is very simple, but has a high collision rate. At most 18% of the channel's capacity can be used. Quantization can be used to improve this to 36%.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma"><a class="toclink" href="#carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma">Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)</a></h3>
<p>Another distributed access protocol. The sender listens to the channel (only really works for wired) before sending, and if it's busy, waits. This is better than ALOHA, but still has a high collision rate due to delay. Only a good idea for small BD-product links.</p>
<h4 id="csmacd-with-collision-detection"><a class="toclink" href="#csmacd-with-collision-detection">CSMA/CD (with Collision Detection):</a></h4>
<p>Used in Ethernet. If a collision is detected, the sender stops sending and waits a random amount of time before trying again. Complicated because everyone involved in collision must be able to detect it.</p>
<p>Nodes have $2 \cdot D_{\text{propagation}}$ time to detect a collision. One can thus impose a minimum frame length of $2D# secones so that nodes can't finish sending a frame before the collision is detected. This is why Ethernet has a minimum frame size of $64$ bytes, and a maximum network length of $500$ m for Coaxial Ethernet, and $100$ m for Twisted Pair Ethernet.</p>
<h4 id="csma-persistence"><a class="toclink" href="#csma-persistence">CSMA "Persistence"</a></h4>
<p>Cannot simply wait until the channel is free, as nodes might just continue to queue up until the channel becomes free and they collide. Instead, design such that heuristically, given $N$ queued senders, the probability of any given node sending is $1/N$.</p>
<h3 id="binary-exponential-backoff"><a class="toclink" href="#binary-exponential-backoff">Binary Exponential Backoff</a></h3>
<p>Given some discrete base quantity of time $q$, after collision $i$, sender waits $t_{i} = q \cdot \text{rand}(0, 2^i - 1)$.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Q = 1 # seconds
def send(frame):
    t = 1
    while not send_frame(frame):
        time.sleep(Q * randint(0, t))
        t *= 2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="math-behind-binary-exponential-backoff"><a class="toclink" href="#math-behind-binary-exponential-backoff">Math behind Binary Exponential Backoff</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Let $k$ be the number of retransmission attempts.</li>
<li>Let $W_k$ be the waiting time for the k-th retransmission attempt.</li>
<li>Let $q$ be a fixed discrete time interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>$W_k = q \cdot \text{randchoice}([0, 2^k - 1])$</p>
<p>Now, calculate the expected value $E[W_k]$:</p>
<p>$E[W_k] = \sum_{i=0}^{2^k - 1} i \cdot q \cdot P(W_k = i \cdot q)$</p>
<p>Since $P(W_k = i \cdot q)$ is uniform $\forall i \in [0, 2^k - 1]$, it is equal to $2^{-k}$.</p>
<p>$E[W_k] = q \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{2^k - 1} i$</p>
<p>$ \sum_{i=0}^{2^k - 1} i = (2^k - 1) \cdot \frac{2^k}{2}$ (sum of first $n$ natural numbers)</p>
<p>$E[W_k] = q \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot ( (2^k - 1) \cdot 2^{k - 1} )$</p>
<p>Simplify further:</p>
<p>$E[W_k] = q \cdot ( (2^k - 1) / 4 )$</p>
<p>Therefore, the expected value of the binary exponential backoff for a fixed discrete time interval $q$ is $E[W_k] = \frac{q}{4} \cdot (2^k - 1)$.</p>
<h3 id="ethernet"><a class="toclink" href="#ethernet">Ethernet</a></h3>
<p>Classis Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), popular in the 80s and 90s. 10 Mbpd over shared coaxial cable. Multiple Access with 1-peristence CSMA/CD with BEB". Modern ethernet is based on switches, avoiding the need for CSMA/CD.</p>
<h4 id="ethernet-frames"><a class="toclink" href="#ethernet-frames">Ethernet Frames</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Addresses to identify sender and receiver.</li>
<li>CRC-32 checksum to detect errors. No ACK or retransmission.</li>
<li>Start of frame identified with phys layer preamble.</li>

        <h1 id="dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp"><a class="toclink" href="#dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</a></h1>
<p><strong>DHCP</strong> is the protocol used to assign IP addresses within a given network. Unlike MAC addresses, IPs are not hard-coded or unique to a device, and can be reassigned to different devices over time. This gives the network much needed flexibility, but also requires a way to manage the assignment of IPs. This is where DHCP comes in.</p>
<p>DHCP sits on top of the <strong>UDP</strong> protocol, and uses <strong>port 67</strong> for the server, and <strong>port 68</strong> for the client.</p>
<h2 id="dhcp-server"><a class="toclink" href="#dhcp-server">DHCP Server</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>DHCP Server</strong> is a device that assigns IP addresses to devices on the network. It is typically a router or a server, and is responsible for managing a pool of IP addresses. When a device connects to the network, it broadcasts a <strong>DHCP Discover</strong> message to the network (sending to addr of all 1s). The DHCP server listens for these messages, and responds with a <strong>DHCP Offer</strong> message. This message contains an IP address that the server is willing to assign to the device. The device then sends a <strong>DHCP Request</strong> message to the server, and the server responds with a <strong>DHCP Ack</strong> message, confirming the assignment of the IP address.</p>
<p>The protocol also supports replicated DHCP servers, which can be used to provide fault tolerance. If a DHCP server fails, the client can simply request an IP from another server.</p>
<h2 id="dhcp-client"><a class="toclink" href="#dhcp-client">DHCP Client</a></h2>
<p><strong>DHCP</strong> clients are pretty ubiquitous, and are built into most devices that connect to a network. To renew an IP address, the client sends a <strong>DHCP Request</strong> message to the server, and the server responds with a <strong>DHCP Ack</strong> message, confirming the renewal.</p>
<h2 id="dhcp-relay"><a class="toclink" href="#dhcp-relay">DHCP Relay</a></h2>
<p>Not all networks have a running DHCP server. In this case, a <strong>DHCP Relay</strong> can be used to forward DHCP messages to a server on another network. The relay listens for <strong>DHCP Discover</strong> messages, and forwards them to the server. The server then responds with a <strong>DHCP Offer</strong> message, and the relay forwards it to the client.</p>

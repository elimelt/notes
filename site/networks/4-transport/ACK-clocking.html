<p>Each in-order ACK advances the sliding window and lets a new segment enter the network. This prevents queuing buildups at slow links, and thus congestion. Segments are buffered and spread out on slow links.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps run with low levels of loss and delay</li>
<li>The network smooths out bursts of data segments</li>
<li>ACK clock transfers smooth timing back to sender</li>
<li>Subsequent data segments are not sent in burts so they don't queue up in the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>TCP uses sliding window, controlling the number of segments in the network. It ensures that only small bursts of segments are sent to keep traffic smooth.</p>
<h2 id="problem-at-the-receiver"><a class="toclink" href="#problem-at-the-receiver">Problem at the Receiver</a></h2>
<p>Sliding window has pipelining to keep network busy, but what if the receiver is overloaded?</p>
<p>Consider receiver with $w$ buffers. Application <em>should</em> <code>recv</code> to accept packets, but if it didn't, then</p>

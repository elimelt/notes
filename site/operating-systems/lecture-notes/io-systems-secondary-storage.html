<h2 id="io-system-hardware-environment"><a class="toclink" href="#io-system-hardware-environment">I/O System Hardware Environment</a></h2>
<p>I/O devices are typically either <strong>block devices</strong>, which transfer data in fixed-size blocks, or <strong>character devices</strong>, which transfer data one character at a time in a stream.</p>
<p><strong>Device controllers</strong> are the hardware (a mini-computer) that connects the CPU to the I/O devices. They are responsible for sending commands to the device, and for receiving and sending data to and from the device.</p>
<p>The I/O devices communicate via controller registers/memory-mapped I/O, or direct memory access (DMA).</p>
<p>Old computers typically had a single bus (the <strong>system bus</strong>) that connects the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. The topology of the computer was similar to old ethernet networks with a single broadcast domain.</p>
<p>More modern and performant systems have multiple buses. The <strong>PCI</strong> bus is a high-speed backbone that all the other busses branch off of (<strong>memory</strong>, <strong>SCSI</strong>, <strong>USB</strong>, etc.).</p>
<p>The I/O system needs to be able to handle a wide variety of devices with different data transfer rates, data formats, and control mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="io-systems-role-and-structure"><a class="toclink" href="#io-systems-role-and-structure">I/O System's Role and Structure</a></h2>
<p>Needs to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A uniform interface to many devices, as well as device specific interfaces when necessary.</li>
<li>Device-system communication and interaction through device drivers.</li>
<li>Every device is given a unique id so it can be referenced by applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization"><a class="toclink" href="#organization">Organization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Programmed I/O with polling</strong>: CPU issues an I/O command for the process, and the process busy waits until the I/O is complete. Inefficient because the CPU is tied up waiting for the I/O to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Interrupt-driven I/O</strong>: CPU issues an I/O command and continues to execute. When the I/O is complete, the device sends an interrupt to the CPU, which then handles the I/O completion. The process may or may not be blocked while waiting for the I/O to complete, but the processor is not tied up waiting for the I/O to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong>: The DMA module controls exchange of data between I/O module and main memory using physical addresses. The processor requests transfer of a block of data from DMA, and is interrupted when the transfer is complete. This saves the processor from having to handle the data transfer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secondary-storage"><a class="toclink" href="#secondary-storage">Secondary Storage</a></h2>
<p>Anything outside of <em>primary memory</em> (RAM) is considered <strong>secondary storage</strong>. This includes hard drives, SSDs, and other storage devices. SS doesn't allow direct execution of instructions or data access via load/store instructions, and is instead accessed via I/O operations.</p>
<p>Secondary storage is...
- <strong>Non-volatile</strong>: Data is retained even when the power is off.
- Very slow compared to primary storage.
- Failure-prone.
- Giant and relatively cheap compared to primary storage. 2024 numbers:
    - 2 TB HDD for $73 ($0.04/GB)
    - 30 TB HDD for $700
    - 500 GB SSD for $50 ($10/GB)
    - 100 TB SSD for $40,000</p>

<p><strong>HDDs</strong> are mechanical devices that store data on spinning disks. They have a read/write head that moves across the disk to read and write data. They are slow, but have a large capacity and are relatively cheap.</p>
<p><strong>SSDs</strong> are solid-state devices that store data on flash memory. They are much faster than HDDs, but are more expensive. They are also more reliable and consume less power.</p>
<h3 id="disks-and-the-os"><a class="toclink" href="#disks-and-the-os">Disks and the OS</a></h3>
<p>Disks are messy, slow, error-prone, horrible devices, and its the OS's job to make them look like a nice, clean, fast, reliable, and easy-to-use device.</p>
<p>The OS typically provides different levels of disk access to different clients, including:
- <strong>physical block access</strong>: the ability to read and write blocks of data to the disk.
- <strong>disk logical block access</strong>: the ability to read and write to a disk block number, without needing to know the physical location of the block.
- <strong>file system</strong>: the ability to read and write files at a specified offset, block, or byte.</p>
<p>With old disks, only physical block access was available. With modern disks, the controller provides a higher-level interface that maps physical regions on disk (cylinders, sectors, ect.) to logical block numbers from $\lbrack  0, n  \rbrack$, (ie a contiguous range of blocks to the OS).</p>
<h3 id="performance-issues"><a class="toclink" href="#performance-issues">Performance Issues</a></h3>
<p>The HDD's performance is affected by its mechanically moving parts. Limiting the amount of seeking and <strong>defragmenting</strong> help, but only to an extent.</p>

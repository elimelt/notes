<p>Windows was written in C, which doesn't have a notion of "objects". Early Windows had its own <strong>Object Manager</strong>, which was responsible for defining object types, naming objects, handling handles for users etc. </p>
<p>For example, there were objects for threads, processes, files, semaphores, etc.</p>
<p>Each object had a <strong>handle count</strong>, the number of handles the user has to the object, and the <strong>ref count</strong>, the number of references to the object within the kernel (which also includes handles).</p>

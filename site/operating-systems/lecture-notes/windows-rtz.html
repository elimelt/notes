<p>Make it faster by picking larger register (same optimization can be done to copy memory).</p>
<p>In early Windows, they picked the BIGGEST register (floating point)</p>

<ul>
<li>Save only the registers needed by the device driver</li>
<li>Who would've thought that a device driver would need to do floating point arithmetic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="garys-sad-story"><a class="toclink" href="#garys-sad-story">Gary's Sad Story</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the Windows team ran nightly stress tests on each new build</li>
<li>Nightly bug checking of parts of the file system on multiple test machines</li>
<li>A <em>showstopping</em> bug was assigned to him. Bug was blue screening many test systems.</li>
<li>Manually checked that <em>RtlZeroMemory()</em> to see if it zeros a buffer correctly. It was not.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out Dave Cutler tried to optimize interrupt handling to not save fp registers. Both <code>RtlZeroMemory</code> and <code>RtlCopyMemory</code> didnt copy the fp registers. When the filesystem calls <code>RtlZeroMemory</code>, if an interrupt occurs and the device calls CopyMemory, this has side effects when control is returned to the process.</p>
<h2 id="moral-of-the-story"><a class="toclink" href="#moral-of-the-story">Moral of the Story</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Many "good" optimizations have unforseen consequences</li>
<li>OS develepment is riddled with examples where modifying code one place breaks code elsewhere.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, bugs in your code are sometimes actually bugs elsewhere, but that won't stop you from being assigned with finding the bug yourself.</li>
</ul>

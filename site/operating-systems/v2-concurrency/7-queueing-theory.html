<p>Simplifying assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work preserving</strong>: The system will eventually process all requests.</li>
<li><strong>FIFO scheduling</strong>: Requests are processed in the order they arrive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server</strong>: Anything that performas tasks, e.g. CPU, disk, network, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Queueing delay ($W$)</strong>: Time a task spends waiting to be scheduled. In a time slicing system (e.g. CPU), this is the sum of all the time it takes for a request to be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Tasks queued ($Q$)</strong>: Number of tasks in the queue.</li>
<li><strong>Service time ($S$)</strong>: Time it takes to complete a task, assuming no waiting.</li>
<li><strong>Response time ($R$)</strong>: Time it takes for a task to be completed, including queueing and service time.
    - Note that $R = W + S$, and that in order to improve overall response time, we need to reduce either queueing time or service time.</li>
<li><strong>Arrival rate ($\lambda$)</strong>: Number of tasks arriving per unit time.</li>
<li><strong>Arrival process</strong>: The distribution of the time between task arrivals.</li>
<li><strong>Service rate ($\mu$)</strong>: Number of tasks completed per unit time. $\mu = 1/S$.</li>
<li><strong>Utilization ($U$)</strong>: Fraction of time the server is busy.
    - $0 \leq U \leq 1$.
    - $U = \lambda / \mu$ if $\lambda &lt; \mu$.
    - $U = 1$ if $\lambda \geq \mu$.</li>
<li><strong>Throughput ($X$)</strong>: Number of tasks completed per unit time.
    - $X = U \cdot \mu$.
    - X = $\lambda$ if $U &lt; 1$.
    - X = $\mu$ if $U = 1$.</li>
<li><strong>Tasks in the system (N)</strong>: Tasks in the system, including those being serviced and those in the queue.
    - $N = Q + U$.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="littles-law">Little's Law</h2>
<p>Defines a very general relationship for any system, and is useful for understanding the relationship between throughput, response time, and the number of tasks in the system.</p>
<p>$$N = X \cdot R$$</p>
<p><em>eg. If the throughput is 10 tasks per second, and the average response time is 5 seconds, then there are 50 tasks in the system.</em></p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Server than processes requests sequentually. The average arrival and departure rate is 100 requests/sec. The average request completes after 5 ms. What is the average utilization $U$ of the system?</p>
<p>$$U = X \cdot R = 100 \cdot 0.005 = 0.5$$</p>
<p><em>Meaning the server is busy 50% of the time.</em></p>
<p>Web service that takes an average of 100 ms to process a request, and handles 10000 queries per second. What is the average number of requests in the system?</p>
<p>$$N = X \cdot R = 10000 \cdot 0.1  = 1000 \text{ queries}$$</p>
<h3 id="response-time-vs-utilization">Response Time vs. Utilization</h3>
<p>Operating a system with high utilization increases risk of overload. If $\lambda &gt; \mu$, the queue will grow indefinitely, and so will the response time.</p>
<p>Higher arrival rate $\lambda$ and burstier arrival process will tend to yield longer queue lengths.</p>
<h4 id="best-case-uniform-arrival">Best Case: Uniform Arrival</h4>
<ul>
<li>$\lambda &lt; \mu$: $R = S$. Queues will shrink until they are empty and remain that way.</li>
<li>$\lambda = \mu$: $R = S$. Queues will remain in a steady state.</li>
<li>$\lambda &gt; \mu$: $R = \infty$. Queues will grow indefinitely. In practice, this would lead to requests being dropped/system failure.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="worst-case-bursty-arrival">Worst Case: Bursty Arrival</h4>
<p>When requests arrive in groups (which they often do), the queue will grow and shrink in response to the bursts. This can lead to a higher average queue length and response time. Even if the average arrival rate is less than the service rate, the queue can still grow if the arrival process is bursty.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following two systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>System 1: $\lambda = 1$ request/second, $S = 1$ second service time, uniform arrival.</li>
<li>System 2: $\lambda = 1$ request/second, $S = 1$ second service time, bursty arrival w/ 10 req every 10 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>System 1 processes requests as they come in, with a queue length of 0. The average response time over a 10 second period is 1 second.</p>
<p>$$
R = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} 1 = 1 \text{ seconds}
$$</p>
<p>System 2 processes requests in bursts, with a queue length that grows and shrinks. The average response time is...</p>
<p>$$R = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 5.5 \text{ seconds}$$</p>
<p>Generally, for a system with arrival rate $\lambda = \frac{n}{t}$ which is a bursty arrival process of $n$ requests every $t$ seconds, and a service time of $S$ seconds, the average response time for each request in the burst is...</p>
<p>$$
R = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot S
$$</p>
<h4 id="exponential-arrivals">Exponential Arrivals</h4>
<p>An <strong>exponential distribution</strong> of a continuous random variable has a mean $\lambda^{-1}$, and a variance $\lambda^{-2}$. Its probability density function is...</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$</p>
<p>It is a <em>memoryless</em> distribution, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in the next $t$ seconds is the same as the probability of an event occurring in the next $t + s$ seconds.</p>
<p>A memoryless distribution is useful because it allows us to model a queue as a finite state machine with states corresponding to the number of tasks in the queue, and transition probablilities $\lambda$ and $\mu$ for transitioning up a state (arrival) and down a state (departure).</p>
<p>Assuming $\lambda &lt; \mu$, the system is stable and we can calculate the response time $R$ as a function of utilization $U$ and service time $S$:</p>
<p>$$
R = \frac{S}{1 - U}
$$</p>
<p>This shows the exponential relationship between response time and utilization. As utilization increases, response time increases very slowly at first, but then increases rapidly as the system approaches overload.</p>

<p>Any two-terminal circuit with only linear elements (resistors) and sources can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source in series with a resistor.</p>
<p>Voltage source represented as $V_{th}$, and resistor as $R_{th}$.</p>

<p>Any two-terminal circuit with only linear elements (resistors) and sources can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source in parallel with a resistor.</p>
<p>Current source represented as $I_{no}$, and resistor as $R_{no}$.</p>

<ol>
<li>find $I_{no}$, the short circuit current from A to B using KCL and KVL.</li>
<li>find $R_{no}$, the equiv shunt (parallel with source) resistance between A and B by replacing voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-the-problem"><a class="toclink" href="#what-is-the-problem">What is the Problem?</a></h3>
<p>Power provisioning for datacenters is challenging because there's a significant gap between maximum power draw ratings and actual maximum power consumption, leading to underutilization of power infrastructure. Building datacenter power capacity is expensive in nature, so this gap represents a significant opportunity for cost savings by ammortizing the cost of building out infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="summary"><a class="toclink" href="#summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>The authors present a 6-month study of power usage patterns across large-scale workloads to evaluate opportunities for maximizing power capacity utilization.  They find a pattern of significant underutilization, which could be used to deploy additional servers within the same power budget.</p>
<h3 id="key-insights"><a class="toclink" href="#key-insights">Key Insights</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The diversity of workloads across a datacenter, as well as the variability between peak and average power consumption, can be safely exploited to increase server density by better matching power provisioning to actual demand</li>
<li>Power capping provides a safety mechanism enabling more aggressive deployment with minimal risk</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notable-design-strengths"><a class="toclink" href="#notable-design-strengths">Notable Design Strengths</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Evaluated effectiveness for both well-tuned applications and more realistic workloads</li>
<li>Large-scale real-world measurements across three major workloads (Websearch, Webmail, MapReduce)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitationsweaknesses"><a class="toclink" href="#limitationsweaknesses">Limitations/Weaknesses</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Wasn't very prescriptive about how to design more cost-effective systems within the context of the findings, just said to reduce idle power</li>
<li>Cooling infrastructure and other relevant costs are factored out of the analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-of-key-results"><a class="toclink" href="#summary-of-key-results">Summary of Key Results</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CPU dynamic voltage/frequency scaling might yield moderate energy savings (up to 23%)</li>
<li>They were able to host between 7% and 16% more computing equipment for individual (well-tuned) applications, and as much as 39% in a real datacenter running a mix of applications</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-questions"><a class="toclink" href="#open-questions">Open Questions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the flat-tax assumption hold up across all datasets?</li>
<li>Is there a general framework system designers can use to decrease their idle power consumption to near-zero?</li>
</ul>

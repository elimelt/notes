<p>Who am I to question Apple's choices, but here we go. Was opting to make Apple Intelligence operate locally the best decision, considering privacy and security concerns? Is it really the smartest decision? If AI doesn't turn into a fiasco, limiting it to what the hardware can support seems like it will always lag behind in a world where technology evolves daily. 🌍📈</p>
<p>Besides, that leaves people who don't have the latest iPhone models holding the bag. ❄️ I understand Apple's conservative approach, but when it comes to AI, is it wise to just play it safe? 🤷‍♂️ Wouldn't an iCloud+ option with AI be a better alternative? ☁️⚙️</p>
